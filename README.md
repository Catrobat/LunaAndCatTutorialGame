# The Magic Word
## A LunaAndCatTutorialGame

The Luna&Cat Tutorial Game is being developed using the [Luna&Cat](https://catrob.at/luna) app in the [Catrobat](https://www.catrobat.org/) language. 

This project was started in 2019 as a [Google summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) project.

This repository host the .catrobat files for the game and all the used sprites and songs.

The latest release can also be found on the Catrobat community and code repository site via TODO.

# Getting Started

In order to access The Magic Word you need to download Luna&Cat from the App Store. 
The next step is to make a Catrobat account. When you have the account, you search
for the user TODO on the Catrobat website. The Magic Word is listed on the userâ€™s page.
The final step is to download The Magic Word.

Another option is to can download  the (file name) from GitHub and copy it onto your Android  phone.
In catrobat you can select "import file" from a drop down menu in the right corner of the 
app.
Current latest version of the game at the following [Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/open?id=17_oLCEx6B9dZXFK1lLqS493gn8X_mwB_).

### Add / Modify Features ###

If you want to send us improvements, e.g., translations, bug reports, or new features send us an email [lunaandcat@catrobat.org](mailto:lunaandcat@catrobat.org). 


* You can simply remix the project by uploading your improved version via [Luna&Cat](https://catrob.at/luna) to the Catrobat community and repository site.

Current latest version of the game at this [Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/open?id=17_oLCEx6B9dZXFK1lLqS493gn8X_mwB_).

### Running the tests ###

In Catrobat code can be tested by going into game mode. 
This is achieved by pressing play.

## Work Done 

 _Every [commit](https://github.com/Catrobat/LunaAndCatTutorialGame/commits/master) is the individual's work, except stating otherwise in the title of the commit._

The [Storyline](https://github.com/Catrobat/LunaAndCatTutorialGame/tree/master/story/Storylines) was based on [Naomi Pfaff](https://github.com/npfaff)'s [research](https://github.com/Catrobat/LunaAndCatTutorialGame/tree/master/story/Research) on the desired audience, while [Stefania Mak](https://github.com/stefaniamak) was in charge of bringing that story to life graphically by [storyboards](https://github.com/Catrobat/LunaAndCatTutorialGame/tree/master/story/Storyboards) and [digital designs](https://github.com/Catrobat/LunaAndCatTutorialGame/tree/master/graphics).

A sequence of images can now be flicked through by touching the screen.
The correct dialogue is assigned to the correct image. When a unit ends
the user is taken to an activity. These features were added to
every unit of the game. 

## Work To-Do 

* Adding the text of Units 0, 1, 2, 4 and 6 in the "language controller" scene. 
Based on this [Google Doc file](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ItitaWzAqJSvqRZuS6hDe5AaZT5WWwsANt6Z1vvS5Ps/edit?usp=sharing).

* Make the "scene" and "block" images easily translatable.
    * Replace the img files within the project with the already existing img files created.
        *[Scenes](https://github.com/Catrobat/LunaAndCatTutorialGame/tree/master/graphics/scenes/empty) / [ScenesV2](https://github.com/Catrobat/LunaAndCatTutorialGame/tree/master/graphics/scenes/empty%20%2B%20scrablle) [Blocks](https://github.com/Catrobat/LunaAndCatTutorialGame/tree/master/graphics/bricks/Empty_) (needs to add a speech bubble on some)
    * Create the same mechanic with the storyline's text over the "language controller" scene.

* After the game is completed, the dialogue will be available in German, English and Greek. 
The option of choosing between these languages will be worked
into the game.

## Merging

The code producing the features listed above was merged with code written
by [Stefania Maks](https://github.com/stefaniamak). [Stefania Mak](https://github.com/stefaniamak)'s code is responsible for the feature that ensures
that users are only able to access a unit if they have successfully completed
the previous unit. A revised version of the dialogue feature was added. It
is the basis for the option of choosing different languages within the game.
[Stefania Mak](https://github.com/stefaniamak) also coded the activities.

## Challenges and Learnings

Code had to be adapted to reduce the size of the game. Simultaneously 
considering the games size and its functionality increased the difficulty 
of the task. However it encouraged us to find the simplest possible way
to create a feature and therefore improved the quality of our work.
