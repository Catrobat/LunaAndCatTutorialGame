## Getting Started

In order to access The Magic Word you need to download Catrobat from the App Store. 
The next step is to make a Catrobat account. When you have the account, you search
for the user TODO on the Catrobat website. The Magic Word is listed on the userâ€™s page.
The final step is to download The Magic Word.

Another option is to can dowload the (file name) from github and copy it onto your adroid phone.
In catrobat you can select "import file" from a drop down menu in the right corner of the 
app.

## Running the tests

In Catrobat code can be tested by going into game mode. 
This is achieved by pressing play.

## Work done 

A sequence of images can now be flicked through by touching the screen.
The correct dialogue is assigned to the correct image. When a unit ends
the user is taken to an activity.These features were added to
every unit of the game. 

## Work left to do 

The dialogue will be available in German, English and Greek. 
The option of choosing between these languages will be worked
into the game.

## Merging

The code producing the features listed above was merged with code written
by Sefania Mak.Stefania Maks code is resposible for the feature that ensures
that users are only able to acess a unit if they have sucessfully completed
the previous unit. A revised version of the dialogue feature was added. It
is the basis for the option of choosing different languages within the game.
Stefania Mak also coded the activities.

## Challenges and Learnings

Code had to be adapted to reduce the size of the game. Simultaneously 
considering the games size and its functionality increased the difficulty 
of the task. However it encouraged us to find the simplest possible way
to create a feature and therefore improved the quality of our work.
