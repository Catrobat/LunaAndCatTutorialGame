# LunaAndCatTutorialGame

The Luna&Cat Tutorial Game is being developed using the [Luna&Cat](https://catrob.at/luna) app in the [Catrobat](https://www.catrobat.org/) language. 

This project was started in 2019 as a [Google summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) project.

This repository host the .catrobat files for the game and all the used sprites and songs.

The latest release can also be found on the Catrobat community and code repository site via TODO (maybe we could change our username to luna&cat tutorial game?)
